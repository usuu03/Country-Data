# Country-Data
The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of the jQuery library for AJAX requests. On loading the web page, a selection element (dropdown list) is populated with a list of regions. This list is obtained through an AJAX request to the server-side script countryData.php, which returns the regions in JSON format.
